She puts up with it by writing rings around him, sledgehammer poems wrapped in velvet, poems of confession and affirmation. That’s the Way the Music Sounds is an eclectic array of poems that are fashioned from flesh and reach the ear in quite a new voice to contemporary poetry, a voice as true and lasting as bone.” –Dan Masterson</span>

            One eighth grade afternoon, the bully on the bus was worse than usual. I came home and wrote a story of revenge in my journal. What satisfaction to leave her bleeding (on paper, of course!) on the playground. Thus was born my career as a mystery writer.
            In college, I majored in psychology, fascinated by what motivates us (or doesn’t). Why did that girl down the hall only write notes to her mother and rarely talk to her? Why did one kid in a family act like a goody two-shoes, while an older brother or sister did drugs and flunked out? Why was the rich girl with all the family connections bulimic? Why did people attend a religious school only to flout all its rules?
            After college, I tested the waters in advertising, catering, retail, and sales, salting away character details in my journals, and in lousy short stories. Then, I did an MFA and entered the world of academic politics, where I currently reside, writing poetry and mysteries, and grading papers.</span>

                    Total mastectomy. Hysterectomy.
                    Hyster--hysterical to trade sexuality for life?
                    This one mutates into ovarian.

                    Another friend, only one attacked,
                    took them both. 
                    No reconstruction.
                    Baggie sweaters, loose blouses,
                    says so little difference 
                    now and before.
                    But the scars?
                    What does it mean 
                    to look in the mirror?
                    Breastless.
                    Breathless.
                    Soul in the breath.
                    Sexuality in the soul.
                    Sexuality in the breath.
                    Breath in the breast. 
                    Can one breathe without them?
                    Finally, only, live in the mind, 
                    abandon the body?

                    Mine are small.
                    Only one aunt died,
                    at 87. 
                    It’s that or a heart attack,
                    my gynecologist 
                    flipped off.
                    No children, I.
                    Not that loss.
                    Even diminutive,
                    I would still wonder
                    before the knife
                    what they meant.

                    In front of the mirror,
                    I extend down the corners of my eyes,
                    stretch out the edges of my nose, 
                    flatten my lips.
                    Just a little
                    makes me someone else.

                    It’s like pulling the dry skin off lips,
                    irresistible until you taste blood,
                    and even then,
                    one last pull and the last
                    translucent slip is free.

                    The blood rises, nerve endings
                    tickling the air like
                    exposed wires.

                    More and more, this is how I feel
                    in our space.
                    All that’s dead we’re peeling back,
                    where we can,
                    the layers of ex-husband,
                    ex-wife, parents,
                    the word “sheep” or “click”
                    or “pie,” perhaps—that brings
                    another word cracked 
                    like a leather belt, 
                    like a branch in a blizzard.

                    We try, but then we pull back,
                    let the scar form, that
                    toughened bit of leather
                    that next time will take a knife,
                    more than plucking at least.

                    Round, etched rose gold,
                    too heavy for any modern
                    Tawainese-sewn pocket,
                    your gift weights my palm, 
                    a drill-punched circle of heavy heart,
                    ticking just slower than time.

                    It arrived after the towers collapsed
                    and my lover’s wife had died
                    and I had won him
                    in a terrible lottery
                    that left me holding the ticket,
                    stunned and silent and so afraid
                    that time had already run through my illicit
                    fingers, slippery, gelatinous.
                    Could I lose him twice
                    to grief?

                    You watch across the reflective mirage of distance,
                    wondering, warm like the heavy inevitable tomorrow,
                    like the parentheses I know
                    I’ll find under my pillow
                    when I’m changing the sheets,
                    the future I won 
                    and can never possess.

                    My shameful inadequacy to love sufficiently 
                    slopes away in pathetic disorder:
                    a mountainside littered
                    with glass and gravel.

                    The watch ticks—
                    that’s my life passing.
                    What do I do with my longing?
                    Its impractical desires bend
                    in all directions at once,
                    a sparkler fizzling in the night air.
